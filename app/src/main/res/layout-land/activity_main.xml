                android:text="During a nine-month period in 1842â€“43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[58] Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.[59] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[60] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[61]  The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Section G[62]), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, which could have run correctly had Babbage's Analytical Engine been built.[63] (Only his Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002.[64]) Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered the first computer programmer[1] and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.[65]  Section G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that &quot;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.&quot; This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot;.[66]" />
